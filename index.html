    <div class="content">
        <p>Last week, President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on critical construction materials, including steel, aluminum, and copper. These measures aim to boost domestic manufacturing but could have far-reaching consequences for the expansion of data centers—facilities essential for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Industry leaders warn that these policies may undermine U.S. competitiveness in AI innovation by driving up costs and creating uncertainty.</p>

        <p>The United States dominates the global data center market, operating more facilities than all other countries combined—ten times more than any single nation. However, their expansion is now threatened by tariffs that increase costs for key materials like steel frameworks, aluminum cooling systems, and copper wiring.</p>

        <p>Data centers already account for 2% of U.S. electricity consumption—a figure projected to quadruple by 2030 as AI adoption accelerates. Meeting this demand will require massive investments in infrastructure and power generation. Yet rising material costs due to tariffs could delay these critical expansions.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>The construction of data centers relies heavily on imported materials like steel, aluminum, and copper. Trump’s tariffs impose a 25% levy on steel imports under Section 232 and similar rates on aluminum and copper. However, exemptions exist for some materials depending on their country of origin or compliance with trade agreements like USMCA.</p>

        <blockquote>"Instability benefits nobody," says Prof. Susan Ariel Aaronson of George Washington University. "The policy contradictions are killing America’s AI competitiveness by driving up costs and creating uncertainty."</blockquote>

        <p>Despite these challenges, major tech companies had announced significant investments in AI-focused data centers before the tariffs were imposed:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apple:</strong> Committed $500 billion over four years to expand data center capacity and build an AI server manufacturing facility in Texas.</li>
          <li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Planned to invest over $100 billion in new data centers in 2025.</li>
          <li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> Allocated $80 billion for AI-enabled data centers this fiscal year.</li>
          <li><strong>Google/Alphabet:</strong> Projected $75 billion in capital expenditures for AI infrastructure in 2025.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The stakes are high—not just for Big Tech but for America’s position as a leader in innovation. Whether the U.S. can navigate these challenges will determine its ability to maintain its edge in the global AI race.</p>
